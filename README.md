# Roadmap FolderSize

## FolderSize.Win32
* Status: Mature
* A foldersize application written in C++ with the explicit intent to reduce the system requirements to a minimum to further reduce deployment pain.
* For those that are interested the source is of course available from codeplex although you need boost to compile it ([www.boost.org](www.boost.org)). I will arrange a setup environment subproject later on.

## FolderSize.Console
* Status: Stalled
* A foldersize application written in C++ with the explicit intent to reduce the system requirements to a minimum to further reduce deployment pain.
* Console UI to be usuable on headless windows servers

## modified version in this repo
* I modified this version to work with .NET Framework 4.8, not show the infobubble, and use a command line parameter (if given) to set the drive or directory to scan. (ajbrehm)
